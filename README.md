## Content

All content written by Flora Jenner (Developer).

The example Code Institute Read Me file, which this Read Me file is based on.

## Media

All images were sourced from Unsplash - a site that provides images for free for commercial and non-commercial use.

## Validator Testing

Both the HTML5 and CSS3 code was put through WSC validators.

HTML5 passed with a warning that I decided was best not to change as it would have ment incorporating an unnecessary div element.
